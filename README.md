# Exploration 1: Discover Angular

*Due Sunday, September 15 at 11:59:00pm*

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to give you the chance to explore a web development topic of your choosing. You might want try something completely new. You could work through a series of tutorials, investigate an API, or learn how to use a new language. It’s also available to choose technologies you’re familiar with. You could further your knowledge in a particular area by digging deeper into the documentation, solving problems, or building demos.

Here soon, we will be going over Angular in this class, so a good topic for this exploration would be to familiarizing yourself with Angular. Then would write a journal style document that demonstrates the things you have explored and you would build a few demos. To learn about Angular, you should read some documentation, watch some videos, and explore projects that have been built with Angular. You can rebuild these projects and build on top of them. The best way to learn a new language is to look into a few examples and then go and build something. What is nice if you choose angular is, you will be knocking two birds out with one stone. You will learn the basic understandings that will help you in class and when we start learning angular, you will already be on top of it. 

Everything following below will use Angular as the example

*NOTE: We will be using Angular 8 in class. However, any resources related to Angular 2+ should be ok at a base level. Avoid anything that says AngularJS, this is a completely separate thing from Angular 2+.*

## Resources

If you choose angular, here are some good links to get you started. This is not an exhaustive list, so you should look at more than just these links.

[Angular Docs](https://angular.io/)

[Fireship YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA) (great channel for learning Angular/Firebase)

[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) (online Angular playground)

## Things to Know

Again, this is not an exhaustive list, and you should include information about more than just these things. The following topics are vitally important things you will need exposure to, to be able to follow along in class.

- TypeScript
- Components
- Modules
- Directives
- Routing
- One- and two-way binding
- Forms
- Template syntax

Keep in mind, we *will* be formally learning these things in class, you are just supposed to be getting a basic understanding so we can spend more class time utilizing these concepts in a real application instead of introducing them. 

For example, in class we will discuss the Angular directive `*ngFor` in depth. You would be expected to know its basic syntax and use case, so we can discuss more complex details of how it works and actually implement it in an application.

## Deliverables 

I am looking for the following deliverables: 

### 1. Sources

Where did you learn and what helped you figure it out? Provide a link to the topic you are investigating and any resources that help you along the way.

For example, if my topic were Angular, I’d provide a link to the documentation:

[Angular Docs](https://angular.io/)

…make note of what components I explore:

- Angular Architecture ([https://angular.io/guide/architecture](https://angular.io/guide/architecture))
- Anglar Modules ([https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules))
- Angular Components ([https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components))
- ngFor ([https://angular.io/guide/displaying-data](https://angular.io/guide/displaying-data))
- ngIf ([https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf))


…and any troubleshooting tidbits that help me solve the problems I run into:

- Problem with ngFor ([https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8602](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8602))
- Angular ngIf issues ([https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular/issues/872](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular/issues/872))
- Angular Material Problem with Scrolling ([https://github.com/angular/components/issues/12128](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/12128))
- Making responsive images in Angular ([https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/image-breakpoints-angular/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/image-breakpoints-angular/))


Some other **sources** you could look into are:

1.  Materialize CSS ([http://materializecss.com/](http://materializecss.com/))
3.  Bulma.io ([http://bulma.io/](http://bulma.io/))
4.  ReactJS ([https://facebook.github.io/react/](https://facebook.github.io/react/))
5.  Tachyons ([http://tachyons.io/](http://tachyons.io/))
6.  Semantic UI ([https://semantic-ui.com/](https://semantic-ui.com/))
7.  Angular JS ([https://angularjs.org/](https://angularjs.org/))
8.  Jquery AJAX ([http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/))
9.  MEAN Stack ([http://mean.io/](http://mean.io/))
10.  Vue JS ([https://vuejs.org/](https://vuejs.org/))
11.  Pure ([https://purecss.io/](https://purecss.io/))
12.  Ember JS ([https://www.emberjs.com/](https://www.emberjs.com/))
13.  Backbone JS ([http://backbonejs.org/](http://backbonejs.org/))
14.  Ulkit ([https://getuikit.com/](https://getuikit.com/))
15.  Elm ([http://elm-lang.org/](http://elm-lang.org/))
16.  Knockout ([http://knockoutjs.com/](http://knockoutjs.com/))
17.  And many many more.

**Remember:** These are only some examples. You don't have to restrict yourself to any one of this. You could also compare a few of the sources above. The more you do the more you will be rewarded.

**Help with Decision:** If you need help on making a decision, try to select a front-end framework that you want to learn ... or better yet, a front-end framework that a company you are interested in is wanting their candidates to know. Then go out and learn as much as you can in the amount of time given.

**Professor Wergeles' Recommendation:** Go out and learn Angular, knock out two birds with one stone. The more you know about Angular, the easier it will be to pick up when we go over it in class here soon. 

### 2. Code

What did you make? Provide samples of code, showing what you learned. These samples can be demos. They don’t need to be polished; they just need to demonstrate what you experimented with.

### 3. Recap 

How did it go? Write about the topic you explored and what you experienced. This is your documentation. The documentation is a journal-style document that details the stuff you have explored.  You can think of it as a journal that reflects what you learned, the problems you faced, and how you solved them. If you go back and run through the material again or think about the TA reading this journal, it should help to guide them through your findings. Almost like your own personal tutorial with explanations. If you are unclear what you need to do for this, then please let me or TAs know.

For example, if you go with Professor Wergeles recommendation, it is important that you reflect what you have learned and demonstrate a basic understanding of the core building-blocks of Angular that way you are prepared for the lectures in class. 

## Tasks

1.  Create a post on the _Exploration 1_ discussion board with your sources, links to running code, and recap **(30 points)**.
    -   I want students to use this for ideas, motivation, and to get involved with the class. However, if two explorations are thought to be copied off each other or cheating is suspected, then no points will be rewarded.
    -   What exactly should be on the discussion board?
        1.  Links to the documentation
        2.  Components you explored
        3.  Trouble shooting tidbits
        4.  Links to your running code on your instance
            -   Show off your work !!
            - But do not share the actual code itself 
        5.  Your journal
            -   The journal should help someone to guide them through your findings and show off how much you explored. Almost like your own personal tutorial
2.  You will zip your sources, links to code, the actual code files, the recap, etc. into a zip file named [Pawprint]Exploration1.zip and submit it here on canvas to be graded  
    -   If your pawprint is abc123 then the zip file will be named Abc123Exploration1.zip
    -   What exactly should be in the zip file? **(120 points)**
        1.  A folder for all your code labeled "Code" **(40 points)**  
            -   This will contain all code (could be typescript, scss, html, css, javascript, configuration files, php, and any other code you wrote for the exploration. The more the better.
            -   The code will **not** be published on the discussion board
        2.  A document that contains your link to the documentation, components you explored, trouble shooting tidbits, the GitHub Repository Link, and a link to your running code on your instance. The document should be named "Sources" with the corresponding file extension **(20 points)**
            -   For example: "Sources.docx"
        3.  Your journal that reflects what you learned, problems you faced, and how you solved them. The journal will be named "Journal" with the corresponding file extension **(40 points)**
            -   For example: "Journal.docx"
            -   Your journal should be clear, easy to read, and be of some help. If the TA is reading it, the journal should guide them through your findings and it should show off how much you explored.
            - Do not submit a text file, make sure it is a nicely formatted file otherwise you will get points taken off 
        4.  A folder for all your screenshots. The folder will be named "Screenshots" which will contain screenshots of code running on the instance with the system clock and URL in the screenshots. The system clock should have the date and time otherwise it will not benefit you. **(20 points)**
            -   For example, you might take a screenshot for each of the pages you implemented running on your instance with the system clock

**Note:** Right now our GitHub classroom is not up, but I plan for it to be up Monday or Tuesday of this coming week. Once it is up, I plan to have students submit on GitHub. Right now this documentation says to submit on Canvas. For this exploration, we may submit on Canvas for a backup, but the primary source will be GitHub classroom. We are just waiting on the verification to go through and we should be ready to go. 

## Help

If there is anything unclear about what you need to do please let me or the TAs know. If you need help, office hours are located under Modules -> Course Information -> CS4830 - Office Hours and TA Information

## Due date/time

Exploration #1 will be **due at 11:59:00PM on Sunday September 15, 2019**. Therefore, you will have approximately 1 week to complete this assignment. This includes both submitting the zip and posting the discussion.
