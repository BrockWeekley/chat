## Install VSCode

The recommended text editor for Angular, and what we recommend you use for this course, is Visual Studio Code.

## Add Angular Extensions to VSCode

This step is optional, but will increase your productivity in Angular. Feel free to download more than these, but these are some that I use regularly.

- Angular 8 Snippets
- Angular Language Service
- Angular2-Switcher
- Auto Rename Tag
- IntelliSense for CSS
- Prettier

## GitHub Classroom

We will be using GitHub classroom. To use this, you will need a GitHub account. To submit assignments, you will follow this process.

1. Click GitHub classroom assignment link posted in Canvas
2. If it is your first time using GitHub classroom, you will link your pawprint to your GitHub account
3. Navigate to your private repo, with starter code, for the assignment
4. Read the instructions for the assignment in `README.md`
5. Clone your repo
6. Complete assignment, committing as usual
7. Push local/master to origin/master

*NOTE: It is recommended to work on a separate branch. In industry, you will never be working in master, so you should get used to the process of working in separate branches. On the next exploration, we make it a requirement to use a separate branch, so getting used to it in this exploration will help you in the future. *
